# Brief Introduction About Myself
I’m a 27-year-old aspiring data scientist with a strong background in management, finance, and entrepreneurship. 
I have a passion for video games and esports. As a former world-class Dragon Ball Legends player, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for strategy, performance analytics, and competitive environments. My background in management and finance, combined with my growing expertise in data science, allows me to approach problems with both analytical precision and creative insight. I’m driven by the idea of using data to understand player behavior, optimize performance, and bridge the gap between gaming and data-driven innovation.
